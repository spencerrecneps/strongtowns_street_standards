# Strong Towns Street Design Guidelines and Principles
The intention of this repository is to act as an example of applying
Strong Towns thinking to the design, construction, and maintenance
of a municipal street system. There are a few important items to note.
First and foremost, this guide is principally concerned with _streets_
as opposed to _roads_. If you are unaware of the difference between
the two please refer to
[this blog post](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2013/3/4/the-stroad.html).

Furthermore, it is important to understand the concept of incrementalism.
That is, our cities are strongest when they develop as a series
of small changes

Lastly, one of the primary concerns of Strong Towns is ensuring the
financial health and viability of our cities. These guidelines are an
attempt to recognize that the materials and maintenance regime associated
with a given street should be commensurate with the wealth generated by
it in the form of the real estate development it enables. For example,
a subdivision of large-lot single family homes is an inherently less
efficient user of public resources than a neighborhood of townhomes.
This code recognizes that the capital improvements dedicated to the former
should be less than the latter. This is not a moral judgment; it is a
financial one.
